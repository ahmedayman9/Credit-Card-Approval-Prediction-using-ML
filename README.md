## Dataset Problems ðŸ¤”
ðŸ‘‰ Credit scoring is a widely used risk management technique in the financial sector. It makes use of personal information and data provided by credit card applicants to estimate future bankruptcies and credit card loans. The bank has the authority to determine whether or not to provide the applicant a credit card. Credit scores can estimate the level of risk objectively.
ðŸ‘‰ A machine learning model is required to predict if an application is a 'good' or 'bad' user in this dataset. However, there is no definition of 'good' or 'bad'. Additionally, the unbalanced data problem is a significant issue in this project.

## Datasets Description ðŸ§¾
* ðŸ‘‰ There are 2 datasets will be used in this notebook:
Application record (contains general information about applicant, such as applicant gender, DOB, education type, assets that applicant had, etc.)
Credit record (contains applicant's loan payment records)
* ðŸ‘‰ There are 18 variables in application record data set:
* 12 categorical variables,
* 5 continuous variables, and
* 1 variable to accommodate the applicant ID.

* ðŸ‘‰ There are 3 variables in credit record data set:
* 1 categorical variable,
* 1 continuousvariable, and
* 1 variable to accommodate the applicant ID.

## What i do ? 
* 1. Making target column to predict on it.
* 2. check missing values and handel it by our Bussiness understanding.
* 3. Feature Generation (Generate new features from the DataSet because the old features not correlated more with the target).
* 4. Select important features correlated with target.
* 5. Solve Imbalance Problem. 
* 6. Apply different ML algorithms.

I reach a good score in Testing and Training
